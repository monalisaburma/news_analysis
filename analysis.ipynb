       " 'Austin Wolcott was 18 years old pretty sure he wouldnt survive year was summer 2020 Wolcott had been given disheartening news his Stage 4 Classical Hodgkins Lymphoma which hed been battling just under year was back Despite aggressive chemotherapy which briefly sent his cancer into remission malignancy spread his vertebrae But his doctors at Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic Chapel Hill North Carolina had an idea Would Wolcott be willing try relatively new experimental treatment something called CART therapy I didnt feel especially hopeful about but I was willing try anything may help says Wolcott Everything about CART sounded like something out sciencefiction movie he says was portrayed as cancerseeking missile knew exactly where go what do description isnt hyperbolic says Dr Michael Chu an oncologist whos been leading CART clinical trials at Cross Cancer Institute Edmonton Alberta CART therapy basically boils down building cells outsmart cancer beating at its own game Cancers arent supposed develop humans Chu explains Our Tcells are capable recognizing killing mutated cells before happens But cancer can be especially sneaky They hide their identifying barcodes so Tcells cant see them CART therapy patients own Tcellswhite blood cells fight virusesare removed from their body genetically edited new barcode reader hence name chimeric antigen receptor CAR Chu says Those new improved cancerkilling canceridentifying machines are returned body ready start an allout cellular war Imagine your Tcells as miniTerminators but without Arnold Schwarzeneggers accent Although he was doubtful Wolcott took chance trial He received his first CART infusion Nov 6 2020 only side effects were some minor body aches he says Within days his cancer was retreating month later was gone As today I am two years eight months 26 days into remission he says CART therapy may not be household name just yet but its cusp revolutionizing cancer treatment Since was first approved by FDA advanced leukemia 2017thenFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb called new frontier medical innovationthe science has jumped by leaps bounds There are now six CART therapies available various blood cancers used target everything from lymphomas leukemia myeloma While still clinical trial stages 2022 report from University Philadelphia found two out three patients treated CART therapy chronic lymphocytic leukemia were more than decade later still remission So many patients have been miraculously cured by CART says Dr John F DiPersio chief division oncology at Washington University St Louis Hes even watched medical colleague cancer surgeon come close death because lymphoma then have complete recovery thanks CART science around CART has come long way since 90s when immunologists like Dr Michel Sadelain were first trying convince their peers genetically engineered Tcells were technology worth exploring beginning was Why would one bother engineer T cells later was will not work says Sadelain who was recently awarded Breakthrough Prize along University Pennsylvania immunologist Carl June his work CART therapy After we demonstrated feasibility efficacy mice 2003 was will not work humans His ideas ran contrary most common approach stimulate Tcells which based vaccines says Sadelain But enough persistence some remarkable early trial results skepticism turned excitement While therapy worked miracles some patients many others did nothing reasons still arent clear Tumors evolve ways suppress immune system says Dr Brian Brown Director Icahn Genomics Institute at Mount Sinai New York City example cancers will flip switch Tcells turn them off They put brake Tcells How they do how Tcells can outsmart cancer cells at their own game still being investigated Theres also problem cytokines pesky molecules released by CART cells promote inflammation can lead dangerously high fevers vomiting organ failure But recent research from Dr Michael Mitchell an associate professor School Engineering Applied Science at University Pennsylvania has developed new method essentially stop cytokine release during CART therapy he says Cells are treated sugars injected polymer called polyethylene glycol which creates what Mitchell calls suit armor around Tcells preventing cytokine release Mitchell feels hopeful new technology wont just make difference current CART therapies but might even demonstrate potential address some grand challenges we face using CART cells treat solid tumors Solid tumors which comprise majority cancerslike breast colon or lung cancer have so far eluded CART therapy Blood cancers are easier attack CAR Tcells says Chu Theyre essentially there blood where CAR Tcells are first introduced But CAR Tcells have find solid tumors by crossing from blood into organs soft tissues Manipulating Tcells into super CAR Tcells armored cells Mitchell developingmight be key finally making CART feasible option attacking solid cancers then theres issue cost outofpocket infusion price can range from 375000 475000 per person while many insurance providers pay at least some bill Medicare instance reimburses around 65 treatment cost thats just procedure itself Side effects like high fever severe nausea trouble breathing can keep CART patient intensive care weeks some have walked away 1 million debt cost must come down says DiPersio most obvious way do by reducing regulatory mandates by FDA which DiPersio thinks unlikely happen or developing offtheshelf therapies which use engineered cells from third party rather than patients own Tcells Big pharma companies like AstraZeneca Novartis are already conducting trials offtheshelf technology Another development could affect staggering costs transforming treatment from lengthy costly hospital visit into an outpatient procedure says Brown goal scenario where patient can come be injected DNA or RNA will turn fraction patients T cells into CART cells they will go kill cancer cells would have big impact cost Despite all hurdles many those involved CART cell research are cautiously optimistic about where technology heading tip iceberg says Chu There are CAR Tcells have shown significant activity against glioblastoma multiforme most common brain cancer including one killed Senator John McCainand some forms muscle bone cancers Brown says CART therapy has potential be used beyond just cancer like inflammation autoimmune disease possibly even treat aging he says Its not science fiction because all these things have already been demonstrated animal models will eventually move humans Though these seismic shifts wont happen overnightoutside pandemics medicine moves slowly Brown says its still remarkable what theyve achieved so far What made Brown believe therapy was something special were living just few minutes after Big Bang as he puts are statistics Its very common us read results from clinical trials new drugs you have squint see difference he says You read how drug extended life sick patients from sixmonth survival an eightmonth survival But CART he says numbers are more startling Theyre reporting remissions more than year you dont have be radiologist see differences tumor masses hadnt just shrunk they were completely gone from these patients Wolcott whos now 22 living his wifewhom he met soon after he got sick Greensboro NC hes still shock cancer he thought would kill him remains moment his rearview mirror day I found out I was officially remission felt like first day my life he says salute 1000 days being cancerfree Wolcott celebrated trip September Blue Ridge Rock Festival Standing dancing hours blazing Southern sun wouldve been unthinkable Wolcott just few years ago There was time during my treatment where I felt like Id spend rest my
